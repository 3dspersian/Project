# **Discovering Vulnerabilities and Assets**

https://github.com/3dspersian/Project

**Introduction:**

**NetRover** is a versatile and powerful tool designed for network and security professionals to discover open ports, perform advanced scans, and identify potential vulnerabilities in target systems. This tool streamlines the enumeration process by offering an automated approach to reconnaissance, access control checks, and asset discovery. Whether you are a penetration tester, security analyst, or system administrator, this toolkit can save you time and effort in your assessment and enumeration tasks.

**Features:**

1. **Fast Nmap Scan:** The program begins by conducting a rapid Nmap scan to identify open ports on the target system. This initial scan provides a quick overview of the services running on the host. (Note: The Nmap section is currently undergoing optimization for speed and accuracy, with opportunities for further improvement.)
2. **Advanced Scans:** After identifying open ports, the toolkit sends this information to a dedicated function that performs advanced scans on these ports. These scans can include banner grabbing, service identification, and more, offering deeper insights into the target.
3. **Access Control Vulnerability Check:** The program evaluates the access control of the target system by attempting to connect to FTP and SMB services using anonymous credentials. This check helps in identifying potential security weaknesses related to access permissions.
4. **FTP File Download:** If the toolkit successfully connects to an FTP service, it initiates a recursive download of all files, helping you obtain a comprehensive inventory of the files present on the FTP server. (Note: There is room for expansion, allowing the FTP module to be used as an automation tool for connecting to multiple FTP servers and downloading all files.)
5. **SMB Share Enumeration:** When connecting to an SMB service, the program lists all available shares. This aids in understanding the structure of shared resources and assists in further investigation. (Note: Similar to FTP, the SMB module can be further developed into an automation tool for connecting to various SMB shares and downloading files.)
6. **SMB File Download:** The toolkit supports recursive file downloads from SMB shares, making it easier to retrieve valuable information from shared resources.
7. **Directory Fuzzer:** The directory fuzzer component allows you to test the responsiveness of web applications by attempting to access directories listed in a user-defined wordlist. This is a useful feature for web application penetration testing.

**Use Cases:**

- **Penetration Testing:** Python Enumeration Toolkit is invaluable for penetration testers, enabling them to quickly identify open ports, conduct thorough scans, and check for access control vulnerabilities.
- **Security Assessment:** Security analysts can use the toolkit to assess network security, detect misconfigured access controls, and gather information for security reports.
- **Asset Discovery:** System administrators can utilize the toolkit to catalog and manage assets by obtaining a list of files from FTP and SMB services.
- **Web Application Testing:** The directory fuzzer is a valuable tool for web application testers, assisting them in identifying hidden resources and vulnerabilities.

**Open Source and Collaboration:**

**NetRover** is an open-source project. This means that it is available to the community for enhancement and improvement. We believe that there is always room for innovation and optimization, especially in the areas of FTP and SMB automation, as well as the speed and accuracy of the Nmap scan. We invite security professionals, developers, and enthusiasts to contribute to this project, helping it evolve and meet the ever-changing needs of the security community.

**Disclaimer:** Always ensure that you have proper authorization and legal permissions before using this toolkit on any system, network, or service that you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
